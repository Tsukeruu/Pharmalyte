# Pharmalyte💊⚕️
**A project aimed to support pharmacists in their day-to-day projects**
  ## Impact💥:
  **Pharmacists often deal with drug compatibility, stability, and compounding. Knowing molecular properties helps answer:**
  
  **Will this drug dissolve in water?🧪**

  **Will it absorb well?🧬**

  **Is it acidic or basic?🧪**

  **Is it stable when mixed with ethanol or propylene glycol?🧪**

  **Is it safe to mix with another compound?☣️**

  **This eliminates the need to search different databases *manually*.**
  
  ##   How to benefit from it:
  ###   If you're trying to be a pharmacist and want to apply day to day chemistry into your life, this project is perfect for YOU as it deals with molecular data and ph, aswell as visualizes it by generating an image of each molecule provided (in smiles format 😊)
